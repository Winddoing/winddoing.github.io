偶然翻出学生时期收藏的一些代码，其中一个看不懂是啥意思，想着编译可能都过不去。没想到的是简单修改几个中文字符后，居然编译过了，运行时发现是一篇日记。

在这里把这段代码记录一下，有机会了再慢慢研究，生成的日记字符比代码本身字符多好几倍

C源码：

``` C
#include <stdio.h>

main(t,_,a)char *a;{
	return!0<t?t<3?main(-79,-13,a+main(-87,1-_,main(-86,0,a+1)+a)):1,t<_?
	main(t+1,_,a):3,main(-94,-27+t,a)&&t==2?_<13?
	main(2,_+1,"%s %d %d\n"):9:16:t<0?t<-72?
	main(_,t,"@n'+,#'/*{}w+/w#cdnr/+,{}r/*de}+,/*{*+,/w{%+,/w#q#n+,/#{l+,/n{n+,/+#n+,/#\;#q#n+,/+k#;*+,/'r :'d*'3,}{w+Kw'K:'+}e#';dq#'lq#'+d'K#!/+k#;q#'r}eKK#}w'r}eKK{nl]'/#;#q#n'){)#}w'){){nl]'/+#n';d}rw' i;# \){nl]!/n{n#'; r{#w'r nc{nl]'/#{l,+'K {rw' iK{;[{nl]'/w#q#n'wk nw' \iwk{KK{nl]!/w{%'l##w#':{nl]'/*{q#'ld;r'}{nlwb!/*de}'c;;{nl'-{}rw]'/+,}##'*}#nc,',#nw]'/+kd'+e}+;#'rdq#w! nr'/ ') }+}{rl#'{n' ')# \}'+}##(!!/"):t<-50?_==*a?putchar(31[a]):
	main(-65,_,a+1):main((*a=='/')+t,_,a+1):0<t?main(2,2,"%s"):*a=='/'||
	main(0,main(-61,*a,"!ek;dc i@bK'(q)-[w]*%n+r3#l,{}:\nuwloca-O;m .vpbks,fxntdCeghiry"),a+1);
}
```
