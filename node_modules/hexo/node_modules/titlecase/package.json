  "readme": "# David Gouch's String#toTitleCase() for Node.js\n\nThis is a fork of David Gouch's excellent [`String#toTitleCase()`](https://github.com/gouch/to-title-case) method inspired by John Gruber's [post on the topic](http://daringfireball.net/2008/08/title_case_update)\n\nI've simply taken it off the `String` prototype and exported it from a simple module.\n\n```js\nvar toTitleCase = require('titlecase')\n\nconsole.log(toTitleCase('foo bar baz'))\n```\n\nSee [Gouch's page](http://individed.com/code/to-title-case/) with inline converter. Also see this excellent **[table of test case results](http://individed.com/code/to-title-case/tests.html)** for different converters.\n\nIn addition, I've added a more comprehensive list of words to not capitalise that includes articles, prepositions and conjunctions (see source files for lists), I'm calling this \"lax title case\", use it like so:\n\n\n```js\nvar toLaxTitleCase = require('titlecase').toLaxTitleCase\n\nconsole.log(toLaxTitleCase('foo bar baz'))\n```\n\n**Using as an executable**\n\nInstall with `npm install titlecase -g` and you'll get a `to-title-case` executable that you can run to titlecase strings:\n\n```\n$ to-title-case \"what is this thing?\"\nWhat Is This Thing?\n```\n\n*Original README:*\n\n# To Title Case for JavaScript\n\nInstructions: Include the to-title-case.js script and use the new .toTitleCase() method on the string you want converted.\n\n## History\n### 2.1 / 2013-11-03\n- Acknowledge characters outside of US-ASCII\n- Fix bug related to hyphenated small words\n- Replace baby's first testing script with the QUnit framework\n\n### 2.0.1 / 2012-01-06\n\n- Fixed IE 7 breakage introduced in 2.0. Don't treat strings like character arrays.\n\n### 2.0 / 2012-01-06\n\n- 15% less code and 35% easier to understand.\n- Small words list moved to variable for easy modification.\n- Test titles rewritten to focus on a single issue per title.\n- More braces to make style guides and JSLint happier.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2008–2013 David Gouch.
